**This is currently in its early stages. **

The notebooks inside look to explore the potential to predict the percentage of songs
in the top 100 of Billboard's charts using autocorrelations and exogenous sound features.

Currently, we have been able to predict the number of pop songs in the top 100, 1 month into the future with a RMSE of 0.032 (3.2% of the songs in the charts).

### Models

- ARIMA
- Exponential Smoothing
- LSTM Networks
